# Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding Platform

## 🚀 Introduction

The Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create and fund projects securely using blockchain technology. It ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transactions. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for authentication and Solidity for smart contracts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

Authentication: JWT, bcrypt

Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat, Web3.js

Storage: IPFS (for storing project metadata/images)

Tools: Metamask, Postman, Docker

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management

User registration & login (JWT-based authentication)

Role-based access control (Admin, Backer, Creator)

Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### 📢 Project Management

Users can create crowdfunding campaigns

Campaigns include funding goal, deadline, and description

Smart contracts ensure funds are released only when the goal is met

### 💰 Funding & Transactions

Backers can contribute funds via cryptocurrency (ETH)

All transactions are recorded on the blockchain

Refunds issued if the campaign fails to meet its goal

### 🔍 Transparency & Security

Immutable transaction records via smart contracts

Project updates & milestones are stored securely

Decentralized file storage using IPFS
